## Description
{My website is generally describing who I am. In it you'll get information about me including my education background , why I chose Moringa School and my hobbies. In the website all these are well explained clearly.}

## Known Bugs
{The website might not be so responsive with devices with small screens since the images might not be seen without users having to scroll a little bit. }
## Technologies Used
{While building the website I managed to use two languages, that is html and CSS.In html I used the various tags to create elements that led to the formation of the website's structure. I used the p tags, the div elements,the h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5 tags. I also used the maquee element to make the images scroll across the page. I used CSS in styling the page, that is giving the different font properties, the background colors of the p elemets and also in styling the nav bar.}
